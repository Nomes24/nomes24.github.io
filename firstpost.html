							<p>Britain needs to stop ignoring its own complicity in the Yemeni conflict. No amount of development aid has any worth, if it goes in hand with the export of the very weapons necessitating that aid. The arms trade to Saudi Arabia must end: as a country, we should not be profiting from genocide. </p>

							<p>To date, the civil war is responsible for over <i>10,000</i> civilian deaths. 14 million are at risk of famine, and the rest survive only due to international assistance. The UN has named it worst humanitarian crisis worldwide for a reason. Yet over time, British arms sales to the region have only grown. In 2017, Saudi Arabia alone accounted for £1.129 billion of British arms exports - an increase of two-thirds on 2016 sales. </p>

							<p>This comes in light of significant evidence that Saudi-led air strikes have caused most of the carnage. Feigned naivety is no excuse. Britain’s own arms trade regulations forbid trade to states even suspected of violating International Humanitarian Law - which the Saudis undoubtedly have. What will it take for Britain to end this deliberate ignorance, and put human life first? </p>

							<p>Moreover the impact of Brexit is pushing the defence sector even closer to the Middle East. Only last week, UK ministers were in Abu Dhabi for the International Defence Exhibition and Conference- the region’s largest arms fair. This follows 63% of weapons sales going to the region in 2017, for a total value of £4.1 billion since 2015. Clearly, war is a lucrative business. Never mind that this comes on the back of Yemeni corpses. </p>

							<p>Britain should feel ashamed to throw its principles out in favour of monetary gain. Once renowned for our human rights law, we now find ourselves in bed with one of the world’s most brutal regimes. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia cannot be seen as anything more than condoning its practices, which include bombings, torture, and executions. In Yemen specifically, they have blocked food and medical supplies: another violation of international law. </p>

							<p>Our guilt is obvious even in the secretive and deniable way sales are conducted. The number of open licenses - allowing unrecorded, uncapped arms exports for 5 years - has doubled. There are no investigations into the legality of client uses. We instead rely on the Saudi’s own investigations – which at the very least will be self-serving. </p>

							<p>The human cost of this British negligence is massive. Air strikes have desecrated local infrastructure, leaving 22 million without access to electricity, clean water, or healthcare. Air strikes using British-made fighter jets, and British-made bombs. Even schools have not been spared: 254 have been destroyed, and countless more damaged. </p>

							<p>The UK’s indifference to the consequence of their arms trade is especially ironic given its own development pledges. Since 2015, Britain has sent £570 million to assist the victims of the conflict. This makes them the leading contributor of aid in Yemen. Simultaneously, they are also the European leader in arms exports. The disparity between these identities is self-evident. </p>

							<p>At the same time, Britain has been active in calling for a peace agreement. Being at the forefront of UN peace negotiations does not negate their participation in the conflict through arms provision. Words can only do so much: we need action, not rhetoric. Where Germany leads by banning sales, we should follow.</p>

							<p>The arms trade to Saudi Arabia needs to end. Not only is it illogical given our development aims; it is categorically disgraceful to support such abuses. In the search for post-Brexit trade, the solution never has and never will be monetizing war. </p>
